Which words shall this message include?</td><td>Distress traffic ended.</td></tr><tr><td>What is normally used for ATIS broadcasts?</td><td>Discrete VHF frequency or/and VOR.</td></tr><tr><td>"The phrase ""BRAKING COEFFICIENT 20"" from ATC means that the braking action is:"</td><td>poor.</td></tr><tr><td>Which information can aircraft in flight obtain by VOLMET?</td><td>Aviation routine weather reports (METAR) of specific airports.</td></tr><tr><td>An Automatic Terminal Information Service provides:</td><td>routine information to arriving and departing aircraft by means of continuous and repetitive broadcast.</td></tr><tr><td>"What does ""FRICTION COEFFICIENT 45"" in a runway report mean?"</td><td>Braking action good.</td></tr><tr><td>Unless a significant change occurs the weather information contained in the ATIS is usually updated every:</td><td>30 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>"Under what runway conditions is the braking action reported to be ""UNRELIABLE""?"</td><td>Runway covered with wet snow and slush.</td></tr><tr><td>How can aviation routine weather reports (METAR) of specific airports be obtained by aircraft in flight?</td><td>VOLMET</td></tr><tr><td>"What does ""FRICTION COEFFICIENT 20"" in a runway report mean?"</td><td>Braking action poor.</td></tr><tr><td>Meteorological information broadcast in VOLMET is the same as:</td><td>METARs with TRENDS and sometimes TAFs.</td></tr><tr><td>What are the propagation characteristics of VHF?</td><td>Practically straight line similar to light waves.</td></tr><tr><td>VHF communications sometimes experience extended ranges as a result of:</td><td>super refraction.</td></tr><tr><td>Which is the frequency separation between consecutive frequencies in the VHF band?</td><td>25 kHz</td></tr><tr><td>What is the lowest frequency where freedom from static interference is likely?</td><td>30 MHz</td></tr><tr><td>Which is the maximum distance at which you might expect solid VHF contact over flat terrain at FL50?</td><td>About 85 NM.</td></tr><tr><td>Which phenomena will normally influence the reception of VHF transmission?</td><td>Level of aircraft and terrain elevations.</td></tr><tr><td>What is the expected range of VHF air to ground communications if an aircraft is flying 35.000 feet above the transmitter height?</td><td>234 NM</td></tr><tr><td>Attenuation of radio waves means:</td><td>the weakening of the radiated waves.</td></tr><tr><td>HF Frequency bands used for aviation are between:</td><td>2 850 to 22 000 kHz</td></tr><tr><td>Which is the maximum distance at which you might expect solid VHF contact over flat terrain at FL100?</td><td>About 120 NM.</td></tr></tbody>
